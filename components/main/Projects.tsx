                <Project src='/projects/weather.mp4' title="Weather App" projectLink="https://github.com/Josh012006/Weather-App">
                    A simple JavaScript based web app that helps you see the weather â›….
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It makes usage of two APIs: one to fetch the country code and another for the weather informations.
                    It displays a solid use of JavaScript and the DOM but also a good understanding of network requests and
                    asynchronous programming.

                <Project src='/projects/express.mp4' title="Selling Website" projectLink="https://github.com/Josh012006/Express">
                    Modest website for selling products coded mainly using Express and Handlebars. It's really simple ðŸ˜„.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This project really helped me using express to handle routes. Through it I've also discovered the usage 
                    of the view engine Handlebars. I've used a middleware to make the site only available between 9 AM and 5 PM.
                </Project>
                <Project src='/projects/movie.mp4' title="Movie App" projectLink="https://github.com/Josh012006/Movie-App">
                    Movie App created using React, React-Router and Express. The configuration is done with Vite.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It's my first real React Project. It's a website where you can search films by their name and display their infos. 
                    The movies' infos are stored in a SQL database.
                </Project>
                <Project src='/projects/tasksCpp.mp4' title="Task manager in C++" projectLink="https://github.com/Josh012006/Tasks-Manager">
                    Simple tasks manager wrote in C++. I haven't done the GUI yet so it runs in the terminal. 
                    But I plan to do it with Qt.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I implemented a task manager that can help you keep your tasks, delete some and even see 
                    the saved tasks. The tasks are saved in a file so that they don't disappear after the user 
                    closes the program.
                    It is fully implemented in C++. I made it so that the code is really easy to understand for 
                    someone with some knowledge of C++ and STL. For the time being it only works in the Terminal. 
                    But there will be an app version done with Qt in the near future.
                </Project>
                <Project src='/projects/tasksJS.mp4' title="Task manager with React and Redux" projectLink="https://github.com/Josh012006/Redux">
                    Task management app written in react using redux toolkit to manage state.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This project make use of React, React Router and Redux toolkit. It's also a task manager but with React and a user-friendly interface.
                    The setup is made using Vite.
                </Project>
                <Project src='/projects/nextjs.mp4' title="Portfolio with Next.js" projectLink="https://github.com/Josh012006/Next-JS">
                    That's the project your are currently looking at. It's done meticulously with Next.js.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It demonstrates my ability to use Next.js to build interesting and complete React apps.
